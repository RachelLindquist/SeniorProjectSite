        <h3>Health and Safety Summary</h3>
        <p>
            We have provided the Oculus Health and Safety guide to help inform you of health risks associated with 
            the Virtual Reality Headset being used for this demonstration. Below is a summary of the information provided
            by the safety guide.
        </p>
        <h3>Radio Frequency Interference</h3>
        <p>
            The headset emits radio waves which may interfere with nearby devices, including medical, such as pacemakers. 
            If you have such a device, it is advised that you do not participate in the demo.
        </p>

        <h3>Seizures</h3>
        <p>
            If you have a history of seizures related to flashing lights from watching television or playing video games,
            it is advised that you do not participate in the demo.
        </p>

        <h3>Discomfort</h3>
        <p>
            VR use is known to cause symptoms similar to motion sickness. Please stop and remove the headset if you begin to feel 
            uncomfortable or notice symptoms of motion sickness, such as vision changes, nausea, lightheadedness or pain in the 
            head or eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do suffer from motion sickness while using the program, it is recommended that you do not drive or engage 
            in any visually or physically demanding activities until you recover. These symptoms may also appear after you have
            removed the headset.
        </p>

        <h3>General Instructions & Precaution </h3>
        <p>
            If you are currently tired or have a headache, please keep in mind that you will be more susceptible to adverse 
            effects when using the headset.
        </p>
        <p>
            While using the headset, it is recommended that you remain aware of your surroundings. 
            Once wearing the headset, it will be hard to look around outside of it. While we will do our best to keep the area cleared, 
            it is still recommended that you do not walk around but instead use the controls available in the software.
        </p>
